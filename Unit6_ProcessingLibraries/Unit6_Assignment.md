__Unit 6 (Processing libraries)__  
__AP Computer Science 2021-22 / Dr. Kessner__  

## Code

Write a program that animates something on screen.  Your program must use an
external class, with a `private PApplet` member variable that is set via the
constructor, and a `display()` function to draw the object. 

## Project

Decide on a project to start working on.  It can be any interactive animation
or video game.  You will be writing in Java, using the Processing libraries.
