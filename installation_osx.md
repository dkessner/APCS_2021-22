# Software installation - Mac

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a software package manager that will help us install everything else we need.

The first step is to install Homebrew:

- Go to the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) and read the installation instructions.
- To install, you will copy/paste a command from their webpage to your Terminal.

You can install everything else with Homebrew, from the command line.

```
brew cask install atom
