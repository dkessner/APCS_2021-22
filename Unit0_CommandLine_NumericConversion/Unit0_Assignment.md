## Numeric conversion

Practice the following numeric conversions:

* `decimal <-> binary, octal, hexadecimal`
* `binary <-> octal, hexadecimal`

Here's a fun way to practice `hex <-> decimal`: Find an RGB color picker
(Processing, Photoshop, Google).  Pick a color.  Look at the hex values,
convert to decimal RGB, and check your work.  Do the same in reverse.

For the others, make up your own exercises and use Google or other online
converter to check your work.

The Unit 0 Quiz will consist of 5 numeric conversions (from the 10 possible
conversion directions listed above). 

## Command line

You won't be tested on stuff related to the command line.  However, you will be
using the command line extensively this year.  Think of your time spent
practicing working on the command line as an investment that will save you time
not only this school year, but any time you do any future work on the computer.
These are some recommended exercises, but I also encourage you to think of your
own exercises and figure out how to do them.

### 1. Practice using the command line

* On paper, draw out a directory tree (2-3 levels deep) with some text files in
  various directories.  

* On the command line, create this directory tree.

* Make a copy (`cp -r`) of an entire sub-tree inside the directory tree.

### 2. Copy someone else's project and modify

Do the following from the command line:

* Copy `class/hello` to your own named directory.  Remember that there are 
    several ways to do this.
* Modify your copy of `hello.py` in your text editor, save, and run to see your
  changes:
    - `atom hello.py`
    - `python hello.py`
* Modify your copy of `Hello.java` in your text editor, save, compile, and run
  to see your changes:
    - `atom Hello.java`
    - `javac Hello.java`
    - `java Hello`

I encourage you to look at your classmates' code this year.  Please feel free
to copy it into your own directory and play around with it.  However, remember
that copying and pasting code into your own project will not help you get any
better at writing code yourself.  Moreover, typing the code in yourself is not
sufficient - if you copy code directly from your eyeballs to your fingers
without it passing through your brain, you might as well be copy / pasting.

_A quick note about the Honor Code_. In light of this discussion, I challenge
you to extend the Honor Code to your personal development in computer science
and writing code outside of class:  Copy and play around with other people's
code all you want, but don't copy/paste into your own project without
attribution, and don't use code you don't understand.

### 3. Practice writing programs

Create a new directory and write the "Hello, world!" programs for both Python
and Java from scratch.  It's okay to look at the example.  This is to practice
copying accurately and getting the programs to run correctly.


### 4. Meow

Here's something fun -- using the `say` command, modify your `meow` command to
audibly meow in addition to printing the ASCII cat.
