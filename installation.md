# Software installation for APCS 2020-21

On OSX (Apple), we will use Homebrew, which is a software package manager.

The first step is to install Homebrew:

- Go to the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) and read the installation instructions.
- To install, you will copy/paste a command from their webpage to your Terminal.

You can install everything else with Homebrew, from the command line.


## Install Java

```
brew cask install java
```

## Install Java 8

```
brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
```

If success: `adoptopenjdk8 was successfully installed!`


## Install Atom

Easiest way is to install with Homebrew:

```
brew cask install atom
```

or you can go to the [Atom website](https://atom.io/).
